# Challenge

Given an integer array of size n, and target number m, determine the two indices of the array where the sum of
the elements at the respective indices is equal to the target number, m. Assume that there is one solution and
the solution should not have repeated indices. Please note down your thinking process in comments so we're able
to see how you approach the problem and think it through.

E.g.

Target = 4  
Input: [1, 2, 3]  
Output [0, 2]

Target = 12  
Input = [2, 4, 3, 1, 9]  
Output: [2, 4]
